## HN++ for Firefox

A Firefox add-on that applies some nice CSS to HackerNews.

## Authors

The CSS is taken from [jarques' Hacker-News-- extention for Chrome](https://github.com/jarques/Hacker-News--)

## Instalation

Download the [xpi file](https://github.com/tadast/Firefox-Hacker-News-plus-plus/raw/master/hacker-news-plus-plus.xpi) and open it with Firefox.

(Will update when I publish this on the Firefox add-on store)
