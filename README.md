## HN++ for Firefox

A Firefox add-on that applies some nice CSS to HackerNews.

![Preview](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/3l3l1A3c1E2R261k1y0E/Screen%20Shot%202015-03-02%20at%2023.09.40.png)

## Authors

The CSS is taken from [jarques' Hacker-News-- extention for Chrome](https://github.com/jarques/Hacker-News--)

## Instalation

You can install it [via Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hacker-news-1/)(recommended) or directly by downloading/cloning the repo and [loading it as a temporary add-on on Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox).

(Will update when I publish this on the Firefox add-on store)
